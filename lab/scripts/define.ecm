/*
 * File: define.ecm
 * A Basic implementation of CommonJS Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)
 * for LIME TV.
 *
 * This basic implementation supports only a subset of AMD:
 *
 * - define(id, factory) with two explicit arguments included, with their
 *   types fixed to string and function
 *
 * - the factory function will always receive the following arguments:
 *   require function and exports object (no module argument is provided)
 *
 * - require function only supports absolute identifiers
 *
 * - the return value of the factory is not considered for exports, only the
 *   exports object is taken into account
 *
 * - module would only contain the "id" property, with is provided in the call
 *   to define(). This argument is thus unnecessary and is not provided.
 *
 * - the property define.amd is not set, because this basic implementation is
 *   not compliant with the full AMD specification
 *
 * This implementation triggers the callback functions registered with define()
 * immediately, without checking if all dependencies have actually been defined
 * in previous calls; undefined values will be returned by require() for
 * missing modules.
 *
 * This basic implementation is intended to be used in LIME TV environment,
 * which allows only the definition of named functions at the global level. To
 * overcome this limitation while preserving the privacy of each module, this
 * define() function cleans up the global space by deleting global properties
 * declared by the module following a convention using the module id as prefix.
 *
 * In this context, the three examples of the AMD API Specification would have
 * to be adapted to call define(id,factory), use require() to get dependencies
 * and declare (transient) global functions deleted after use in define():
 *
 * Example 1:
 * The name of all global functions is prefixed with the identifier of the
 * module, to avoid conflicts with other modules caused by function hoisting
 * and allow automatic clean-up of global scope in define():
 *
 * | function alpha_verb() {
 * |   return require("beta").verb();
 * | }
 * |
 * | function alpha_factory(require, exports) {
 * |   exports.verb = module1_verb;
 * | }
 * |
 * | define("alpha", alpha_factory);
 *
 * Example 2 (now similar to Example 1):
 *
 * | function module2_verb(){
 * |   return require("alpha").verb() + 2;
 * | }
 * |
 * | function module2_factory(require, exports) {
 * |   exports.verb = module2_verb;
 * | }
 * |
 * | define("module2", module2_factory);
 *
 * Example 3 (now similar to Example 1 and Example 2):
 *
 * | function module3_add(x, y){
 * |   return x + y;
 * | }
 * |
 * | function module3_factory(exports){
 * |   exports.add = module3_add;
 * | }
 * |
 * | define("module3",module3_factory);
 *
 * The functions declared by a submodule of "alpha" would not be deleted, even
 * though their name starts with the prefix "alpha_", because their name
 * contain an extra underscore after the prefix:
 *
 * | function alpha_submodule_action(){
 * |   require("alpha").verb() * 2;
 * | }
 * |
 * | function alpha_submodule_factory(require, exports){
 * |   exports.verb = require("alpha").verb;
 * |   exports.action = alpha_submodule_action;
 * | }
 * |
 * | define("alpha/submodule",alpha_submodule_factory);
 *
 * Notes:
 *   o all arguments must be set explicitly for this implementation of define()
 *   o object literal notation {} is not supported, it must be replaced with
 *     new Object(). The same applies to array literal notation [], which must
 *     be replaced with new Array();
 *   o line comments are not supported and must be replaced with block comments
 *   o strict comparison operators === and !== are not supported; typeof can be
 *     used in combination with == and != to ensure strict equality.
 *   o try/catch is not supported
 *   o function.apply() and function.call() are not supported

  /* Function: define(id, factory)
   * Define a module created by a factory.
   *
   * The factory function is called immediately and is expected to set
   * properties on the exports object it receives as argument for each function
   * that it wishes to publish. This object is stored and associated with given
   * id, which enables modules to retrieve the exported object by calling
   * require() with the same id.
   *
   * All global properties of the module are expected to be named with
   * following conventions; they will be deleted from the global scope:
   *  - name starts with the id, with any '/' replaced with '_' separator,
   *  - followed with an '_' separator,
   *  - followed with a name in camelCase with no further '_'.
   *
   * The intent is to protect properties declared by other modules as well as
   * properties declared by submodules (whose id starts with the module id
   * followed with a '/' e.g. "module1/submodule1").
   *
   * Parameters:
   *   id - string, absolute identifier of the module.
   *   factory - function(require,exports,module): any, callback which will be
   *             called immediately, with

   *             o exports - object, the module object holding the public
   *                         properties set in the factory, which will be
   *                         associated with the given identifier and returned
