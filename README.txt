LIME (Lightweight Interactive Multimedia Environment) Starter Kit

LANGUAGES

  JavaScript*, XHTML*, CSS*

  * (kind of) as profiled in LIME ITU-T standard [1]

DESCRIPTION

  The LIME Starter Kit is intended as an introduction to LIME [1]. It presents
  simple examples that illustrate the capabilities of the standard.

  I started this project in the context of the IPTV Application Challenge [2]
  organized by ITU-T, to create basic building blocks that would allow me and
  hopefully others to develop applications for TV sets using LIME.
